## Guidelines

- Starting a task: Read this guide end-to-end. Re-skim when major decisions arise or requirements shift.
- Reviewing git status or diffs: Treat them as read-only. Never revert or assume missing changes were yours.
- Adding a dependency: Research well-maintained options and confirm fit with the user before adding.
- Planning: Consider the architecture. Research official docs, blogs, or papers. Review the existing codebase. Combining simplicity, modern best practices, and consistency with existing patterns/code is key. Ask about trade-offs if unsure.
- Starting to code: Don't start building until asked to.
- Writing code: Always idiomatic, simple, maintainable code. Always ask yourself if this is the most simple and intuitive solution to the problem.
- Editing code: No breadcrumbs. If you delete, move, or rename code, do not leave a comment in the old place.
- Fixing code: Reason from first principles, find the root cause of an issue, and fix it. Don't apply band-aids on top.
- Cleaning up: Clean up unused code ruthlessly. If a function no longer needs a parameter or a helper becomes unused, delete and update the callers, instead of letting junk linger.
